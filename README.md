## Introduction

Human pose estimation is a critical task in computer vision with applications in various fields such as human-computer interaction, animation, and surveillance. This project combines the strengths of CNNs (simple feature extractor) with CRFs and HRNet (specialized feature extractor for tasks requiring high-resolution representations like Human Pose Estimation) with Chain Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to improve the accuracy of pose estimation.

## Dataset

We use the COCO dataset, a large-scale dataset for object detection, segmentation, and keypoint detection.

## Concepts

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are deep learning models designed for processing structured grid data, such as images. They are composed of layers that apply convolutional operations to capture spatial hierarchies in the data. In this project, CNNs are used for basic feature extraction from the input images, and then passed on to the CRF model for modeling dependency between body parts and joint inference.

### High-Resolution Network (HRNet)

HRNet is a specialized neural network architecture designed for high-resolution representation learning. Unlike traditional networks that downsample the spatial resolution, HRNet maintains high-resolution representations through the entire network, making it particularly effective for tasks requiring precise localization, such as pose estimation.

### Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)

CRFs are a class of statistical modeling methods used for structured prediction. They are particularly useful for labeling and segmenting sequential data. In this project, CRFs are used to model the features extracted by the CNN and HRNet models separately, enhancing the accuracy of keypoint dependency and localization.

## Model Architecture and Training

### Feature Extraction

1. **CNNs**: Used to extract initial features from the images. These features capture basic patterns and structures relevant for pose estimation.
2. **HRNet**: Specialized for pose estimation, HRNet extracts features much like the CNN but while maintaining high spatial resolution, crucial for accurate keypoint detection.

### Model Training

#### Train CNN and HRNet Models

We train models for CNN and HRNet for feature extraction.

#### Train CRF Model with Features from the Basic CNN Model

We combine the feature maps from the CNN with a CRF model to refine the keypoint predictions. This involves training the CRF using the features extracted by the CNN.

#### CNN+CRF Training

The CNN and CRF are trained together to optimize the pose estimation performance.

#### Train CRF Model with Features from the HRNet Model

Similarly, we train a CRF model using features extracted from the HRNet to further refine the pose predictions.

#### HRNet+CRF Training

HRNet and CRF are trained together, leveraging HRNet's high-resolution features and CRF's refinement capabilities.

### Evaluation and Visualization

#### Skeleton Connections

We visualize the predicted keypoints by drawing skeleton connections between them, providing a clear representation of the estimated poses.

#### Percentage of Correct Keypoints

We evaluate the model performance using the percentage of correct keypoints, a common metric in pose estimation tasks.

## Conclusion

Combining CNNs, HRNet, and CRFs provides a robust approach to human pose estimation, achieving high accuracy in keypoint localization. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating these models and highlights the potential for further improvements and applications in various domains.
